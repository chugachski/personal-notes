# Language Concepts

## Compiled vs. Interpreted
- Source: human readable code that you create
- Translation: conversion of source into a computer-readable format (machine code)
- Run-time: the time of execution
- Compilation: code is translated before run-time
- Interpretation: code is translated during execution

## Typing
### When are the types checked?
1. Static: types checked before run-time
2. Dynamic: types checked during execution

### Can the values change type?
1. Strong: variable of a type cannot change over time
2. Weak (or loose): variables can change type over time
